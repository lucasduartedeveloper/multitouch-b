Take me down to your paradise
Won't believe until I see the light
Break me out, make me so alive
I'm craving you like I need a high
I'm a desert, you're an ocean
It's your motion that I need
But without you, I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat
Take me down to your paradise
I lose my words every time I try
To make sense on why I lose my mind
You're every wrong that I need at night
I'm a desert, you're an ocean
It's your motion that I need
But without you, I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat
Without you, I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat
Without you, I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat
Without you, I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat
Take me down to your paradise
I see heaven when I see your eyes
They pull me in, got me paralyzed
Your body makes me wanna testify
I'm a desert, you're an ocean
It's your motion that I need
But without you, I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat
Without you, I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat
Without you, I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat
Without you, I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat
Take me down to paradise, paradise
Take me down to paradise, paradise
Take me down to paradise, paradise
Take me down, down, down
Take me down to paradise, paradise
Take me down to paradise, paradise
Take me down to paradise, paradise
Take me down, down, down
Down, down, down
Without you, I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat!
Without you, I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat
Take me down to paradise, paradise
Take me down to paradise, paradise
Without you, I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat
Take me down to paradise, paradise
Take me down to paradise, paradise
Without you, I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat
Without you, I am broken
Left to thirst out in the heat
